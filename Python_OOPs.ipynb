Polymorphism is one of the most important concepts of object-oriented programming languages. The most common use of polymorphism in object-oriented programming occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. Here we will see how to represent any function in many types and many forms. In a real-life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different roles to play in life. Like a woman, at the same time is a mother, a wife, an employee and a daughter. So the same person has to have many features but has to implement each as per the situation and the condition. Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming."

        "**Ans.**-The __del__ method in Python, also known as a destructor, is called when an object is garbage collected, immediately before it is destroyed. It provides an opportunity to clean up resources held by the object, such as closing files or releasing external connections. However, relying on __del__ for resource management is generally discouraged due to its unpredictable timing and potential for errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The del statement in Python decreases the reference count of an object, and when the reference count reaches zero, the object becomes eligible for garbage collection. The __del__ method is then called by the garbage collector before the object's memory is reclaimed.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that the timing of garbage collection is not guaranteed and depends on the Python interpreter's implementation and memory management strategies. Therefore, __del__ should not be used for critical operations that require timely execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of __del__, it's recommended to use context managers (with statement) or explicit cleanup methods for resource management. Context managers ensure that resources are properly acquired and released, even in the presence of exceptions.\n",
